Spring Boot Calculator App
This project is a simple calculator application built using Spring Boot. It implements common mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project was developed primarily as a learning tool to explore core Object-Oriented Programming principles—encapsulation, abstraction, composition, inheritance, and polymorphism—along with getting hands-on experience with the popular Java Spring Framework. Additionally, the application is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
